Self-taught, proactive and self-driven web developer. I first came in touch with programming for the web 10 years ago.

Started by writing some basic plugins for CS 1.6 in php, later switched to Unityscript and Unity engine for game development.

Unityscript is based on Javascript, so it was a nice intro (and a complex one) to web development and Javascript in general.

Since 2019 I've been coding with passion for the web, solving complex problems and building major business features for startups.

Some technologies I really enjoy working in are React.js, Next.js, Node.js, SCSS, Typescript.
I utilize my experience to bring designs to life, identify areas for improvement, ship quality code.
Coding is a path of learning, we never stop and I enjoy it.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
